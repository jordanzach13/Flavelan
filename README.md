## Ideas
Front End should be angular
Backend should be C#
Architect the front end replaced / hot swapped with a java backend for the fun of it.

### Style
- I want a top bar with a slideout a toggle able slideout on the left side.
- DO I want the page content to get cover by the slideout or moved around by the slideout
- Do I want a simple bottom bar.
- Dark Mode: Black and Neon Purple. Light Mode: White and Lilac.
### Basic About / Home Page
- I'd like the color scheme to be black and neon purple or if on light mode a white and a lilac
### Farkle
- I want a page for a farkle game
- I want a pop that can show the scoring rules
- Eventually it would be nice to mess around with physics and set up some feature that way
### Dice Rolling
- I want a page to roll any number  of vairius dice like 2d6 + 5d4 + 1d20
### Video Game Archvive
- I want page that I can use to view and add statuses to games.
- Things like Finished, Playing, Paused. Trophy status, Rating. Wishlists?
### DnD
- I want a fluid initiative tracker.
- As part of this I want some kind of room / encounter I can host and another tab / person can join
#### DM / Host Abilities
- As the host / dm I want to be able to add a NPC and a PC
- I want a stat block for NPC's and maybe PC
- I want a way to toggle status effects, like bloodied, on fire, blinded...
- As the DM i want to be able to rearange initiative in the middle of the battle or add new things the encounter
- I'd like to be able to upload an image
- If so desired i'd like to be able show a specific npc's AC
- I also want for the first round to be able to hide NPC iniative placement until they come up
#### Player view
- I want a queue similair to what is in baldurs gate.
- I want some indication of a status effect on a creature
- Maybe even a combat timer to help keep things moving?
